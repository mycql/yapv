# Using YAPV with other libraries

YAPV's most flexible implementation [YAPV SVG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yapv/svg), is built using a small [library](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp/tree/V1) with a hyperscript based API, so it plays well with other hyperscript based libraries (e.g. React) and can leverage on hyperscript based component templating (e.g JSX).
